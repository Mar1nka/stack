# Product ðŸŽ‰ Stack ðŸŽ‰ [![Build Status](http://product-stack-ci.paralect.com/api/badges/startupsummer/product-stack/status.svg)](http://product-stack-ci.paralect.com/startupsummer/product-stack)

Product Stack is a number of small solutions combined together in one repository with a goal to improve products quality and time to market.

Main concepts:
1. Every component has an owner who maintain and contribute to the component, keeping it up to date all the time and fixing any issues.
2. Based on the current Product Stack components we build and support `Mainstream Product` - which is what we think best set of tools and technologies for starting product development. While we offer a `Mainstream Product boilerplate`, you can use individual components for your product development.
3. Every Product Stack component has extensive documentation which allow to learn it quite quickly.  

## Tools

Get in touch for invitations with Andrew Orsich.

1. [Slack](https://product-stack.slack.com)
2. [Drone CI](http://product-stack-ci.paralect.com)
3. [Internal Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ZmxYFqWa/product-stack-development)
4. [NPM Organization](https://www.npmjs.com/org/paralect)
5. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/paralect/dashboard/)

## Technology Stack

To make collaboration simpler and more efficient we will focus around very specific and concise technology stack, which includes following:

1. Node.JS 8, Koa.JS 2
2. React.JS with Redux, POST CSS, Koa.JS 2
3. MongoDB, PostgreSQL
4. Ansible, Docker, Drone CI

## Product stack Distribution

We distribute Product Stack components in four main ways:

1. As public [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages under common `@paralect` account.
2. As source code, which you can just copy/paste to get started
3. As public docker images for isolated services under common `paralect` DockerHub account.
4. As Ansible roles for common deployment tasks

### Contribute to Product Stack

We want contributing to Product Stack to be enjoyable, educational and fun for everyone. There are multiple ways to contribute:

1. Help with documentation. Great documentation is a key.
2. Submitting bug fixes or grammar fixes.
3. Adding unit or functional tests.
4. Adding new ideas to include into Product Stack.  
5. Implementing new solutions, that will be used across many products.
6. Helping answering questions in the github issues.

### Structure of the repository

Eventually we want to group solutions into logical groups, but since there is high probability of mistake. As we just starting we will keep things simple in the beginning and come up with a structure later on. For the moment every solution should just lie in his own folder and contain README.md with comprehensive description.

### Product Stack Node.JS Mainstream product

This is sample project built based on Product Stack components, which basically what we think an ideal solution to start new project at any given point of a time.

In the mainstream product we try to solve all common challenges you run into when starting new product development. In many cases we've seen that after fast shipping of the MVP version the codebase remains in the very bad state. One of our goals is to keep shipping MVP even faster, while keeping code quality high. While we make a lot of trade offs in the mainstream product we make sure that common things, which are typically left out of the scope (logging, monitoring, CI, deployment, etc) handled properly.

Mainstream product consist following high level parts:

1. Landing site based on lovely, React based [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/). Landing site is fully integrate with api and consist following pages:
  - Main landing page
  - Signup
  - Signup success
  - Signin
  - Forgot password
  - Reset password
  - Accept invitation
  - Privacy policy
  - Terms of service
2. [Restful API](./koa-api-starter/README.md), connected to the MongoDB that implements landing site functionality.
3. Koa, React.JS based Single Page Application which shows after you login on landing site. Have configuration for development and production environments.
4. Application deployment using Ansible
5. Continuous integration server using Drone CI
6. MongoDB backups to S3
7. Monitoring using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
8. Common application stats tracking using [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf)
9. Configured development environment with hot reloading for the web part using webpack and server auto restart using nodemon.

Some common problems which already solved in the mainstream product:

1. [Error/info logging](./common-logger/README.md)
2. [MongoDB connections/reconnections](./mongo-node8/README.md).
3. Requests validation
4. [Common code styles](./conventions/js-style/README.md)
5. Running tests locally
6. Running tests in CI


Unstructured notes:

1. All product services start with a single command `./bin/start.sh` using docker-compose.
2. All applications has linting tests configured in package.json and running in the Drone CI.
3. Restful api has defined approach of writing integration/unit tests using mocha, sinon.
4. Deployment and configuration of Drone CI using Ansible.
5. Production, staging deployment pipeline declared and implemented using Drone CI.
6. Server(s) configuration & deployment routines implemented using Ansible.
7. Mainstream product consist MongoDB to s3 backups deployment routine.
8. All applications already have Docker images declared for development and production environments.
9. MongoDB migrations configuration
