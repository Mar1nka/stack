# Stack ðŸŽ‰ [![Build Status](http://product-stack-ci.paralect.com/api/badges/startupsummer/product-stack/status.svg)](http://product-stack-ci.paralect.com/startupsummer/product-stack)

Stack is a number of small components combined together in one repository with a goal to improve products quality and time to market.

Main concepts:
1. Every component has an owner who maintain and contribute to the component, keeping it up to date all the time and fixing any issues.
2. Every Product Stack component has extensive documentation which allow to learn it quite quickly.  

## Tools

Get in touch for invitations with Andrew Orsich.

1. [Slack](https://paralect-stack.slack.com/messages)
2. [Drone CI](http://product-stack-ci.paralect.com)
3. [Internal Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ZmxYFqWa/product-stack-development)
4. [NPM Organization](https://www.npmjs.com/org/paralect)
5. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/paralect/dashboard/)

## Technology Stack

To make collaboration simpler and more efficient we will focus around very specific and concise technology stack, which includes following:

1. Node.JS 8, Koa.JS 2
2. React.JS with Redux, POST CSS, Koa.JS 2
3. MongoDB, PostgreSQL
4. Ansible, Docker, Drone CI

## Product stack Distribution

We distribute Product Stack components in four main ways:

1. As public [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages under common `@paralect` account.
2. As source code, which you can just copy/paste to get started
3. As public docker images for isolated services under common `paralect` DockerHub account.
4. As Ansible roles for common deployment tasks

### Contribute to Product Stack

We want contributing to Product Stack to be enjoyable, educational and fun for everyone. There are multiple ways to contribute:

1. Help with documentation. Great documentation is a key.
2. Submitting bug fixes or grammar fixes.
3. Adding unit or functional tests.
4. Adding new ideas to include into Product Stack.  
5. Implementing new solutions, that will be used across many products.
6. Helping answering questions in the github issues.

### Structure of the repository

Eventually we want to group solutions into logical groups, but since there is high probability of mistake. As we just starting we will keep things simple in the beginning and come up with a structure later on. For the moment every solution should just lie in his own folder and contain README.md with comprehensive description.

1. [Product Stack Ideas](./IDEAS.md)
1. [Product Stack Solutions](./SOLUTIONS.md)

### Ship is based on Stack
