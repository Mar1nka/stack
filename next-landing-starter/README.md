### Why next.js

##### **Server-side rendering (SSR) a.k.a. [universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) app**
SSR is the requirement for the modern landing websites which allows the indexing of single-page applications for search engines such as google. Which means you can continue to have fun with your [favorite UI library](https://github.com/facebook/react) while having your awesome stuff seen in the web for everyone.

##### **Bundled react.js + webpack**.
Even though landing websites are often considered to consist of mostly static pages which do not require a tone of javascript code, we believe that having the same library across all your ecosystem leads to *predictable*, *clean*, *reusable* and *extendable* code.
<br />Because the basic handling of the form input with raw JS code is not a very pleasant thing, don't you remember?

##### **Prepared app structure with clearly defined conventions**
Next.js is built to simplify the life of developers and remove boilerplate code while giving the power of the latest technologies so it fully correlates with our goals.

##### Community driven and widely popular framework
Next.js is the most popular SSR framework for react with constant updates and improvements and big number of contributors. Two heads are better than one, 20k is even better.
